# markdown.github.com

This is an effort to document the current status of Markdown by and for the
community.

## Jekyll

This branch uses `jekyll` to generate the website. You can install it by
following the instructions at [the jekyll repository on GitHub][1].

To run the website locally, run

    jekyll --auto --server

It will recompile the website as you save files and sever them on
http://localhost:4000.

Note that the configuration currently uses the `rdiscount` Markdown processor.
