## About

Markdown is formatting syntax that is lightweight, easy to write and easy to read.  It's main goal is to be as readable as possible as plain text:

> "The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make
 it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted
 document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
 like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
 Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
 filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax
 is the format of plain text email." - [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

Various libraries are available to convert markdown into structurally valid XHTML. This makes it possible to produce rich text documents in a syntax that's nearly as powerful as HTML, but much easier to use.

### History

Markdown was originally authored by John Gruber and Alex Swartz and is officially hosted at John Grubers [site](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Markdown rose in popularity after [Github](https://github.com) implemented it and since then many other sites have followed.

### The future

The markdown community hopes to use this site and its [associated Github account](https://github.com/markdown) to [be a better parent](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/12/responsible-open-source-code-parenting.html) to Markdown.  It will be a central location for information on markdown and will help move markdown forwards and into maturity.
